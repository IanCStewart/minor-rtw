# Minor Real Time Web
> This is a Repo for the course Real Time Web.

## The project

The project will be to build a real time web application based on realtime data from an external server. The client will see this dynamic data on the client side (*in a web-browser*).

> For a demo with sockets in a chat I have the [following repo](https://github.com/IanCStewart/minor-part-up). I will soon add a different kind of demo here.
